SUMMARY:
Dollar-Rupee could test 66.60 within its currently narrow range of 66.60-90. Euro-Rupee and Yen-Rupee could see a pause in the their rise today.

DETAILS:
As expected, the FOMC kept rates unchanged and the chances of a December rate hike remain high enough. US Yields are down a bit as a result. Stock markets, including Nifty (8535, +0.2%) remain low ahead of the US elections, although results will be out only after a week. The Dow Jones (17959.64, -0.43%) had closed marginally below 18000 yesterday.

The Rupee is relatively stronger at 66.70 within its currenly narrow range of 66.60-90, in a late reaction to the overall Dollar weakness. A further dip to 66.60 may be seen, which may hold as a Support for the week.

As mentioned last evening, the Euro-Rupee (74.10) and Yen-Rupee (0.6484) have continued to rise on strength in the Euro (1.1110) and Yen (102.80). The Euro-Rupee may see a pause in its rise now as it has Resistance at 74.30 for the day. The Yen-Rupee also faces intra-week Resistance at 0.6500 for today. A near term dip could be seen in both, over today/ tomorrow.
