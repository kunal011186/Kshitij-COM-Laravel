17-04-2019,1277.8,Resistance at 1325 has held well and Gold has fallen below 1290. Can test 1260 in May. If Support at 1260 is broken by end-May, Gold could be further bearish towards 1250-1225 by July while below 1290. HOWEVER, we have to note that 1260-50 could be a strong Support, as could be the end of an A-B-C correction coming down from 1350. Failure to break below 1260-50 could set up a fresh rally to 1300.
