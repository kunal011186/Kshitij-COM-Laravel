SUMMARY:
Stock and Bond markets both signal weakness for Rupee. Tomorrow may be ranged between 66.60-90. Next week might move up towards 67.40.


DETAILS:
Stocks lost further ground today and the Nifty (8484.95, -29.05) has closed below 8500. A fall towards 8300 is possible while the market trades below 8582.

The 10Yr GOI (6.913%) continues to inch up and is trading above 6.90%. If the upmove sustains, a further rise towards 7.0% could be seen. If so, it would be negative for Rupee.

Dollar-Rupee saw an intra-day low of 66.66 but then closed higher than yesterday's close of 66.7150. With tomorrow being the end of the week, the overall sideways range of 66.60-90 may sustain tomorrow as well. 

Going into next week, however, there is a 65% of seeing a spike up towards 67.40. The lesser chance (35%) is of a dip to 66.40.




FORWARDS..Higher
Premia are higher.  The 1, 3, 6 and 12 months are at 5.50%, 5.51%, 5.58% and 5.37% compared to 5.56%, 5.45%, 5.48% and 5.32% Yesterday.

In paisa terms Premia trading near 23.00 (end-Nov -16), 53.75 (end-Dec-16), 86.00 (end-Jan-17) 176.00 (end-Apr 2017) and 351.50 (end-Oct 2017). 

That said, we note that the 6-mth Premium (5.58%) is starting to move up. It has long-term Support at 5.37% and near-term Resistance at current levels. If the 10Yr GOI moves up further, the Forward Premia might also move higher. Need to keep an eye on this.
