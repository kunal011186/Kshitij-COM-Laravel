SUMMARY:
Dollar Rupee almost unchanged from yesterday’s close of 66.71 and may remain stable in the narrow range of 66.60-80 for the day. US elections next week may be the key to a break above 67.00 for 67.40-50.

DETAILS:
The chances of a Fed rate hike this December has appreciated to 78% according to Fed funds futures market, up from 69% last week. The NFP data to be released today is expected to come strong at +173,000 for October against 156,000 in September which may justify a rate hike.

But the stage is being set for the US elections now. With only a couple of trading sessions left before the event affects everything, the market participants are busy allocating and switching money to various asset classes.

While Dollar Rupee (66.71) remains unaffected in its range of 66.60-70, Dollar (97.26) and the equities including Dow (17930.67, -0.16%) and Nifty (8462.40, -0.27%) are bleeding money which flows into the safe havens like Yen (103.06), Gold (1299.95) and even Euro (1.1096).

The Brexit fear is driving a lot of gambling money to bets on a Trump win but the best election barometer at this point, the Mexican Peso (USDMXN 19.1440) looks positioned for a stronger level against Dollar in the coming weeks with downside limited to 20.10. A break above 18.40 may be upside trigger for Peso. 

The Peso implies that the bigger money is still placed on a Hillary win, which can keep the markets stable. But a surprising Trump win may trigger real panic and push Dollar Rupee higher above 67.00 to 67.50.
