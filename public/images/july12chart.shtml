<h5>Chart Explanation</h5>
Europe stands out for the huge surge in unemployment, even as the
employment situation in other countries has either stabilized or improved a
bit. Quite evidently, its high unemployment can push Europe into another
recession and slow down global growth considerably. That's the issue the
markets are dealing with for the medium term.

<b>Chart A</b> There has been a secular, almost identical decline in the Dollar, US Bond prices and the Dow against Gold since 2002. As such, what we are seeing today could be Dolla bashing at its zenith. Is a turnaround (currently unthinkable) approaching?
</td>
<td valign="top" class="write">
<b>Chart B</b> The Dollar Index has broken below its important Support near 77 and is looking weak for further fall to 75-74. The Bond Yields are also finding Resistance near current levels and if it fails rise then there is a threat of yields falling sharply. Having said this the Dollar might continue to remain weak.
